**Birb**
By Ayaan Grover

This piece of artwork was created to represent the universe - an incredibly enormous yet beautiful existence that is constantly changing. This artwork, which is also my first blot artwork, shows how something as simple as a bird(or a birb, as people may call it) can represent such different ideas and objects - a bird, a hooded figure fishing, and a jellyfish-like animal. I made it for my little sister who loves birds, and I think it looks just like her - very happy, young, and about to randomly burst into song. I hope you like it.
